The website is on a developing stage. For now website is only a CV page(website and mobile version). I am planing create a full site that will includes the following features:

* Home: A page that introduces the developer and provides a brief overview of their skills and experience.
* Portfolio: An interactive gallery showcasing the developer's past projects, with the ability to view project details and click through to live demos.
* Skills: A comprehensive list of the developer's technical skills, including proficiency levels and relevant experience.
* Contact: A contact form where visitors can reach out to the developer for inquiries, collaborations, or hiring opportunities.
